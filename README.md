# SetupScripts
Set of scripts for installing the DAGMC-Trelis plugin and its dependencies on a clean machine.
There are currently 5 stages of installation: MOAB, DAGMC, Trelis, Trelis SDK, and the DAGMC-Trelis plugin.
Some scripts advise the exporting of several path variables; it is necessary to update these to continue to the next script.
When running scripts, be sure to use sudo -E to preserve necessary path variables.
